1. take screenshot
2. extract text from fixed locations
3. pass to OCR to get text values
4. get text values back and pass to API/backend local logic
5. retrieve possible values
6. format results

Image Considerations
- different screen resolutions
-- relative screen locations? need to test

- crop images or pass sections?
-- image manipulation, done in preprocessing / numpy?
--- numpy arrays > if its proportional to screen resolution, can do array math on imported image?

Todo
-fixed 5 points for the tags, identify hard locations? scaled locations?
-- for now, do fixed locations based on test data, use that information to get relative information
